The early age of onset, the rapid progression of symptoms followed by stabilization, and the presence of a variety of other neurological disorders (e.g., sociopathic behavior; TICS; MUSCLE SPASMS; oculogyric crises; hyperphagia; and bizarre movements) distinguish this condition from primary PARKINSON DISEASE. Pathologic features include neuronal loss and gliosis concentrated in the MESENCEPHALON; SUBTHALAMUS; and HYPOTHALAMUS.

FTD, the most common subtype of FTLD, is a behavioral variant characterized by changes in social and personal conduct with loss of volition, executive dysfunction, loss of abstract thought, and decreased speech output. A second clinical subtype of FTLD is 'semantic dementia,' characterized by specific loss of comprehension of language and impaired facial and object recognition. A third clinical subtype of FTLD is 'primary progressive aphasia' (PPA), characterized by a reduction in speech production, speech errors, and word retrieval difficulties resulting in mutism and an inability to communicate. All subtypes have relative preservation of memory, at least in the early stages. FTLD is often associated with parkinsonism or motor neuron disease (MND) resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; OMIM:105400) (reviews by {47:Tolnay and Probst, 2002} and {32:Mackenzie and Rademakers, 2007}). {30,31:Mackenzie et al. (2009, 2010)} provided a classification of FTLD subtypes according to the neuropathologic findings (see PATHOGENESIS below).\n\n<Subhead> Clinical Variability of Tauopathies\n\nTauopathies comprise a clinically variable group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized neuropathologically by accumulation of abnormal MAPT-positive inclusions in nerve and/or glial cells. In addition to frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and PPA, different clinical syndromes with overlapping features have been described, leading to confusion in the terminology ({47:Tolnay and Probst, 2002}). Other terms used historically include parkinsonism and dementia with pallidopontonigral degeneration (PPND) ({56:Wszolek et al., 1992}); disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex (DDPAC) ({29:Lynch et al., 1994}); frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FLDEM) ({57:Yamaoka et al., 1996}); and multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD) ({46:Spillantini et al., 1997}). These disorders are characterized by variable degrees of frontal lobe dementia, parkinsonism, motor neuron disease, and amyotrophy.\n\nOther neurodegenerative associated with mutations in the MAPT gene include Pick disease (OMIM:172700) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; OMIM:601104),\n\nInherited neurodegenerative tauopathies linked to chromosome 17 and caused by mutation in the MAPT gene have also been collectively termed 'FTDP17' ({28:Lee et al., 2001}).\n\n{25:Kertesz (2003)} suggested the term 'Pick complex' to represent the overlapping syndromes of FTD, primary progressive aphasia (PPA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), PSP, and FTD with motor neuron disease. He noted that frontotemporal dementia may also be referred to as 'clinical Pick disease' and that the term 'Pick disease' should be restricted to the pathologic finding of Pick bodies.\n\n<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration\n\nMutations in several different genes can cause frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with or without motor neuron disease. See FTLD with TDP43 inclusions (OMIM:607485), caused by mutation in the GRN gene (OMIM:138945) on chromosome 17q21; FTLD mapping to chromosome 3 (OMIM:600795), caused by mutation in the CHMP2B gene (OMIM:609512); inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and FTD (IBMPFD; OMIM:167320), caused by mutation in the VCP gene (OMIM:601023) on chromosome 9p13; ALS6 (OMIM:608030), caused by mutation in the FUS gene (OMIM:137070) on 16p11; ALS10 (OMIM:612069), caused by mutation in the TARDBP gene (OMIM:605078) on 1p36; and FTDALS (OMIM:105550), caused by mutation in the C9ORF72 gene (OMIM:614260) on 9p.\n\nIn 1 family with FTD, a mutation was identified in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1; OMIM:104311) on chromosome 14, which is usually associated with a familial form of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD3; OMIM:607822)."], "id_eng": "OMIM:600274", "definition_kw": ["Right temporal lobar atrophy (RTLA) is an anatomic variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by behavioral dysfunction, personality changes, episodic memory loss, and prosopagnosia; attributable to an asymmetrical predominantly right-sided, frontotemporal atrophy.", "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) refers to a clinical manifestation of the pathologic finding of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

These phenotypes exemplify the diversity that can result from mutation of a given gene. Most affected individuals have some, but not all, of the features of a given phenotype; nonetheless, the following nomenclature can assist the clinician in diagnosis and management. Onset of the POLG-related disorders ranges from infancy to late adulthood.Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), one of the most severe phenotypes, is characterized by childhood-onset progressive and ultimately severe encephalopathy with intractable epilepsy and hepatic failure. Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) presents between the first few months of life up to about age three years with developmental delay or dementia, lactic acidosis, and a myopathy with failure to thrive. Other findings can include liver failure, renal tubular acidosis, pancreatitis, cyclic vomiting, and hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA) now describes the spectrum of disorders with epilepsy, myopathy, and ataxia without ophthalmoplegia. MEMSA now includes the disorders previously described as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE). The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) includes the phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). About 90% of persons in the ANS have ataxia and neuropathy as core features. Approximately two thirds develop seizures and almost one half develop ophthalmoplegia; clinical myopathy is rare. Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (arPEO) is characterized by progressive weakness of the extraocular eye muscles resulting in ptosis and ophthalmoparesis (or paresis of the extraocular muscles) without associated systemic involvement; however, caution is advised because many individuals with apparently isolated arPEO at the onset develop other manifestations of POLG-related disorders over years or decades. Of note, in the ANS spectrum the neuropathy commonly precedes the onset of PEO by years to decades. Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) typically includes a generalized myopathy and often variable degrees of sensorineural hearing loss, axonal neuropathy, ataxia, depression, Parkinsonism, hypogonadism, and cataracts (in what has been called ???chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus,??? or ???CPEO+???).
